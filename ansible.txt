====== Configuring SSH server access for Ansible ======
On the server client : 
<code>$ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "you@youremail.com"</code>

Save the file and logout. Now we need to copy the local SSH key to the remote server, by running:

>  $ ssh-copy-id username@test.example.com

You will be asked to provide the password for username in the server. You will see an output similar to this:
<code>
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
username@test.example.com's password: 
Number of key(s) added: 1
Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'username@test.example.com'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
</code>

After doing this, you should be able to log in just by running:

>  $ ssh test.example.com

This is ideal because you will be able to run Ansible with default settings, and no need to provide extra parameters and login / password for performing the commands and executing playbooks.
